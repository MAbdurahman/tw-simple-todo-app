# tw-simple-todo-app
This is a simple application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks. It uses
HTML5 for structure, CSS3 with Tailwind CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, enabling users
to manage their tasks dynamically. On desktops and laptops, drag and drop feature is added to allow users
to arrange and rearrange their tasks. Tasks are persisted in the browser's local storage, ensuring that
users can access their tasks even after closing the browser.
